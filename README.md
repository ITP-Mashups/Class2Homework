Starting this assigment, I realized I didn't know the best way to insert data returned from an API directly into an HTML file. While taking this class
I am reading the book "JavaScript and JQuery" by Jon Duckett. In the book, it showed how to edit the DOM with JavaScript, so I elected to do this using
the innerHTML property. I also used css examples from the book to create this page. I attempted to get rid of all the css code I didn't understand and changed the code I did understand. 

The other learning curve for this week was figuring out how to get data from an API. I used Open Weather Map to get the data I used on this page utilizing a call to their API directly in the browser's search bar. I am excited to learn how to more efficiently access and utilize data from APIs soon.
