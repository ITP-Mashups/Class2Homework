# Class2Homework
1. Describe the assignment:
This assignment is to watch the Lynda.com JS video and reading a piece on JS. In addition, we need to create a webpage with some of the data returned by an API.

2. A link to the hosted project, if not using localhost:
I have a Squarespace page that I can use to host, I just need help setting it up.

3. Discuss what you chose to do and why:
I chose to get data from the shopstyle.com API. I have the key, but I'm not sure where to put it in order to get a response.

4. Document any resources/research/inspiration:
My inspiration is my love for fashion. I'm thinking maybe I can have fun with it for this project.

5. Explain your process: 
I am having trouble coding through Github. I have basic coding skills and I know how to make simple websites, I just don't understand this whole Github thing and how to edit code and see the split screen results with it. I am used to DreamWeaver. I am going to try to do my homework on there and then transfer it to here. Next, I want to get data from shopstyle.com API. I have the key, but I'm not sure where to put it in order to get a response...I'm not sure how to "make an order" from the server. Do I just type that URL into the browser? I tried that and it did spit out a whole lot of code so maybe that worked...I'm going to put this lot of code into my webpage and hope for the best...this did not work...UGH. 

6. Highlight both successes and failures:
Success: I was able to type in an API URL and it spit out some data!
Failure: 1. I have no idea how to incorporate that data into my webpage, nor do I fully understand how this works. Where does JS come into play with this?
         2. As mentioned before, I don't know how to host my project. I do have a Squarespace website that maybe I can host it on? I'm a bit confused.
