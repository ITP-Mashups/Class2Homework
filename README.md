# Class2Homework
This assignment is to watch the Lynda.com JS video and reading a piece on JS. In addition, we need to create a webpage with some of the data returned by an API.

I have a Squarespace page that I can use to host, I just need help setting it up.

I want to get data from shopstyle.com API. I have the key, but I'm not sure where to put it in order to get a response.

My inspiration is my love for fashion. I'm thinking maybe I can have fun with it for this project.

In the Lynda.com video I don't understand how to use loops. 
I am having trouble coding through Github. I have basic coding skills and I know how to make simple websites, I just don't understand this whole Github thing and how to use it. I am used to DreamWeaver. I am going to try to do my homework on there and then transfer it to here. Next, I want to get data from shopstyle.com API. I have the key, but I'm not sure where to put it in order to get a response...I'm not sure how to "make an order" from the server. Do I just type that URL into the browser? I tried that and it did spit out a whole lot of code so maybe that worked...I'm going to put this lot of code into my webpage and hope for the best.

highlight both successes and failures
