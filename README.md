# Class2Homework

I am looking at itp.nyuu.edu/ranch and itp.nyu.edu/ranch/api to get interesting statistics about students. For this homework, I am hitting the endpoint https://itp.nyu.edu/ranch/api/itp-yearbook/2018 to get folks graduating in 2018. It returns a json of the format:

{
    "id": "1234",
    "classyear": "2018",
    "netid": "abc123",
    "name": "John Doe"
}

I am taking only the Names and Year and presenting it in an aesthetically pleasing way (yeah right!!!)

In future extensions of this homework, I hope to use further apis to look at what people have done over the years and make correlations of how projects have evolved.
