# HW 1 Journal

I was out this week, so most of my homework assignment is based off of what I learned in projects for previous courses, and questions I asked Tyler (who was in class).

I have basic knowledge of web development, like how to organize my each file and distribute organization, style, and interactivity through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I looked at some old projects I had to remember the basics of setting up a page, and the provided boilerplate helped.

Using an API for information retrieval was totally new to me though. I registered as a developer with Spotify to use their API with my project, and this week I spent most of my time just getting set up with that and learning to make a basic call. This wasn't incredibly easy, as Spotify does have some security around use of their services and I had to apply for credentials.

My webpage displays information from a simplified version of the JSON object that an actual API call would return. The simplified/removed parts would have connected to other objects returned in an actual call. For example, an album object would normally contain an array of track objects, but since I was just using an object defined in my script, my pseudo-album object doesn't refer to these other objects. I'm looking forward to learning how to make real dynamic calls to the API, I read a lot of documentation this week and I'm looking forward to the payoff of actually developing something interesting.
