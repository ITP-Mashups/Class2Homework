Read - MDN - Javascript Basics
Install - A JS Linter for your Text Editor (I use Sublime Linter for Sublime)
Download the Postman App for easy API pinging
Create - a single web page that displays (some of) the data returned by an API url. Your page must have some basic css styling. You must have an .html file and .css file. Feel free to copy and paste your data into the DOM, you DO NOT need to programatically connect your page to the data. Submit your homework via the Week 2 Homework Repo.
